# ThermoGravimetry

## Overview

This firmware is not done; it is aimed at helping to understand the method for determining the products of thermal decomposition, a process called [thermogravimetry]. Ploting the data is called a thermogram and may help identify a compound’s decomposition reactions.

It would be interesting to measure the exothermic reaction heat content during the decomposition of an organic sample (e.g., fuelwood, fuel oil). The ICP1 input might be used to measure the airflow and some analog loop sensors for the intake and exhaust temperature. Infrared spectroscopy [absorption bands] data might also be useful to consider.
