# Makefile based non-blocking Blink

## Overview

Demonstration of General I/O, e.g. Blink an LED. 

It also links an Interrupt-Driven UART library for AVR Standard IO facilities, as well as some Python that sends an 'a' character to stop the LED from blinking. 

## Firmware Upload

The manager needs to be told that it has a localhost and the address to bootload. I do this with some commands on the SMBus interface from an R-Pi.

``` 
sudo apt-get install i2c-tools python3-smbus
sudo usermod -a -G i2c your_user_name
# logout for the change to take
python3
import smbus
bus = smbus.SMBus(1)
#write_i2c_block_data(I2C_ADDR, I2C_COMMAND, DATA)
#read_i2c_block_data(I2C_ADDR, I2C_COMMAND, NUM_OF_BYTES)
# what is my address
bus.write_i2c_block_data(42, 0, [255])
print("'"+chr(bus.read_i2c_block_data(42, 0, 2)[1])+"'" )
'2'
# I want to bootload address '1'
bus.write_i2c_block_data(42, 3, [ord('1')])
print("'"+chr(bus.read_i2c_block_data(42, 3, 2)[1])+"'" )
'1'
# clear the host lockout status bit so nRTS from my R-Pi on '2' will triger the bootloader on '1'
bus.write_i2c_block_data(42, 7, [0])
print(bus.read_i2c_block_data(42,7, 2))
[7, 0]
exit()
```

Now the serial port connection (see BOOTLOAD_PORT in Makefile) can reset the MCU and execute optiboot so that the 'make bootload' rule can upload a new binary image in the application area of flash memory.

``` 
sudo apt-get install make git picocom gcc-avr binutils-avr gdb-avr avr-libc avrdude
git clone https://github.com/epccs/Gravimetric/
cd /Gravimetric/Applications/BlinkLED
make
make bootload
...
avrdude done.  Thank you.
picocom -b 38400 /dev/ttyAMA0
...
a
#exit is C-a, C-x
```
