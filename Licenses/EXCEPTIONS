License Exception:

Even though Gravimetric (product) in general is covered by the Licenses,
this does *not* cover the so-called "applications" that use the 
"bootloader" service by means of a jump table provided exactly for 
the this purpose - this is merely considered normal use of the
product, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".

  The header files define the interfaces.  Including these header
files in another file is considered normal use of the product, and does
*not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
